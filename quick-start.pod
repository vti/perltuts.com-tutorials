=head1 ABSTRACT

This tutorial is a quick start for non-experienced non-programmers. It tries to
cover the basics and does so in a gradual manner.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tutorial is a quick start for non-experienced non-programmers. It tries to
cover the basics and does so in a gradual manner.

=head1 TUTORIAL

=head2 Hello, world!

Let's try from the simple example. This example is a common example in all
programming tutorials and books, it prints "Hello World". Try running the
following program, you should see the output.

    say 'Hello, world!'

Here C<say> is a function that accepts arguments and prints them out.

=head3 Exercise

Try fixing the following code so it prints 'Bye':

    say ''

    __TEST__
    like($stdout, qr/Bye/, 'Should print Bye');

=head2 Safety belt

Often programmers make mistakes that are perfecly fine from the language syntax
view but have logical issues that create hard detectable bugs.

In order to detect typos and various gotchas Perl provides two very useful
pragmas C<strict> and C<warnings>. They are recommended for use in every piece
of code. All the examples in this tutorial imply these two lines, they are not
shown just for the space saving.

You don't have to understand the following code, just see the difference between
using safety pragmas

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    $x += 1;
    $y .= 'string';

    say 'ok';

and not using them

    no strict;
    no warnings;

    $x += 1;
    $y .= 'string';

    say 'ok';

=head2 Numbers

Numbers are integers (1, 2, 5) and floats (1.2, 1e5). There is no real
difference between them. Perl treats them the same and autoconverts
automatically.

Try printing the following numbers:

    say 1;
    say 4.4;
    say 1.2e10;

As you can see the statements are ended with C<;>. This is like a dot that we use
to separate sentences.

=head3 Arithmetic operators

Basic arithmetic manipulations include: C<+> (addition), C<-> (subtraction),
C<*> (multiplication), C</> (division), C<**> (exponent) and C<%> (modulus).

    say 1 + (10/5) * 3

=head4 Exercise

Print out the result of 5 to the power of 6.

    say
    __TEST__
    like($code, qr/\*\*/, 'Operator ** should be used');
    like($stdout, qr/15625/, 'Should be 15625');

=head2 Strings

Strings are declared by using single or double quotes. The difference is not so
important for now. In our Hello World example the C<'Hello, World'> was
a string.

    say 'foo'

=head3 Basic string operators and functions

Strings can be concatenated (glued) using a C<.> operator.

    say 'foo' . 'bar'

With operator C<x> you can repeat the strings.

    say 'foo' x 3;

Usually you would want to manipulate strings in order to get their lengths, find
a symbol or a substring and so on. Basic string manipulation functions include
length(), substr(), index(), rindex().

    say length 'foo';
    say substr 'foo', 1, 2;
    say index 'foo', 'o';
    say rindex 'foo', 'o';

=head4 Exercise

Print out the position of string C<'ball'> in string C<'Football'>.

    say
    __TEST__
    like($code, qr/index/, 'Function index should be used');
    like($stdout, qr/4/, 'Should be at pos 4');

=head2 Lists

Lists are, well, lists of values. They are declared by using brackets.

    say (1, 2, 3, 5)

Often you can use ranges to save some typing:

    say (1 .. 5)

This also works on characters.

=head4 Exercise

Print out a list of characters from C<'b'> to C<'m'>.

    say
    __TEST__
    like($stdout, qr/bcdefghijklm/, 'Should print out bcdefghijklm');

Lists of course can hold not only numbers, but also strings:

    say (1, 'hello', 2, 'there')

Lists used inside other lists are flattened:

    say (1, (2, 3, 4), 5)

=head2 Assignment and variables

Assignment in computer programming languages is an operation of storing a value
somewhere in the computer's memory that is accessed by its name.

In Perl 5 there are three built-in data types: scalars, arrays and hashes (or
associative arrays). Scalars can hold strings and numbers. Arrays are ordered
lists of scalars where values are accessed by index. Hashes are unordered
associative array where values are accessed by keys. Variables that hold
scalars, arrays or hashes are prefixed with C<$>, C<@> and C<%> respectively.

Variables are usually declared by using my keyword. For example:

    my $x = 1;
    say $x;

=head4 Exercise

Assign to a variable C<y> string C<'Hello, world!'> and print it.

    my $
    say
    __TEST__
    like($stdout, qr/Hello, world!/, 'Should print "Hello, world!"')

=head3 Scalars

Depending on what the variable holds (a number, a string) there are different
operators your can use.

Let's say you want to sum two number values:

    my $x = 1;
    my $y = 2;

    say $x + $y;

Or you want to concatenate two string values:

    my $x = 'Hello';
    my $y = 'There';

    say $x . $y

If you will try to use C<+> on strings or C<.> on numbers they will be
automatically converted to appropriate types.

    my $x = 1;
    my $y = '2 times';

    say $x . $y;
    say $x + $y;

As you can see in the second example the string '2times' was converted to
number, which is 2.

=head4 Exercise

Contatenate and print the string C<'Result='> and the sum of C<42> and C<13>.

    my $x = ;
    my $y = ;

    say

    __TEST__
    like($stdout, qr/55/, 'Should print "Result=55"');

=head3 Arrays

Arrays can hold a list of scalars.

    my @array = (1, 2, 3);

    say @array;

Basic array manipulations include getting an element by index (starting from 0),
getting the last index, shifting and popping values.

    my @array = (1, 2, 3);

    # Get the third element
    say $array[2];

    # Get the last index
    say $#array;

    push @array, 4;
    say @array;

    pop @array;
    say @array;

    shift @array;
    say @array;

    unshift @array, 0;
    say @array;

As you probably have noticed when accessing array element we changed C<@> to
C<$>, because the element of array is a scalar, and scalars are prepended with
symbol C<$>.

=head4 Exercise

Give the array that holds list C<(1, 2, 3, 4)> print the third element.

    my @array = ;
    say 

    __TEST__
    like($stdout, qr/3/, 'Should print 3')

=head3 Hashes

Hash or associated arrays are unordered collections of scalars that can be
accessed by a key. A key is usually a string.

    my %hash = ('key1', 'value1', 'key2', 'value2');

Instead of using comma for separating keys and values Perl provides a more
readable operator C<< => >>, for example:

    my %hash = (key1 => 'value1', key2 => 'value2');

Basic hash manipulations

As with arrays when accesing hash key, the variable becames a scalar, we use
symbol C<$> and braces C<{}>:

    my %hash = (key1 => 'value1', key2 => 'value2');

    say $hash{key1};

=head3 Geting all hash keys and values

    my %hash = (key1 => 'value1', key2 => 'value2');

    say keys %hash;
    say values %hash;

=head2 Context

Context is a very important concept in Perl. There are two main contexts: scalar
and list. Context usually affects how the functions and variables behave. This
is close to the natural language.

The most popular usage is getting an array length for example. Normally when you
use array in list context it returns all its elements, but when used in scalar
context it returns its length.

    my @array = (1, 2, 3);

    my @array2 = @array; # list context
    say @array2;

    my $length = @array; # scalar context
    say $length;

=head2 Logical and comparison operators

Before we introduce the corresponding Perl operators here are the basics of
Boolean algebra.

Boolean algebra is a variant of algebra where instead of numbers are truth
values C<0> and C<1>, where C<1> is called C<truth>, and C<0> is called
C<false>.

Like in a normal algebra there are operations like C<+>, C<*> etc, the basic
ones are called C<NOT>, C<AND> and C<OR>. As you already know in Boolean algebra
we have only C<Truth> and C<False> values. That means that not only they can be
used in different operations, but also the result of those operations is either
C<Truth> or C<False>. Let's look at them one by one.

=head3 Truth and False

There are no C<Truth> and C<False> values in Perl. In Perl C<Truth> is
everything that is not C<False> where C<False> is everything that converts to
C<0>: C<0> itself, C<''> (empty string), C<undef> for example.

=head3 NOT

C<NOT> operator is a unary operator, which means it operates on one value. In
Perl C<NOT> operator is C<!>. C<NOT> truth table:

=begin html

<table style="width:10px">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>x</td>
            <td>!x</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

=end html

Let's see what are the results of using this operator on various values. In the
following example we add C<0> to C<False> values so they are not converted to
empty strings by C<say> function.

    say !0;
    say !1 + 0;
    say !'string that converts to 1' + 0;
    say !'';

=head3 AND

C<AND> operator is a binary operator, which means it operates on two values. In
Perl C<AND> operator is C<&&>. C<AND> truth table:

=begin html

<table style="width:10px">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>x</td>
            <td>y</td>
            <td>&&</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

=end html

Let's see what are the results of using this operator on various values. In the
following example we add C<0> to C<False> values so they are not converted to
empty strings by C<say> function.

    say 1 && 1;
    say 0 && 1;
    say 0 && 0;
    say 'string' && 1;

=head3 OR

C<OR> operator is also a binary operator, which means it operates on two values. In
Perl C<OR> operator is C<||>. C<OR> truth table:

=begin html

<table style="width:10px">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>x</td>
            <td>y</td>
            <td>||<td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

=end html

Let's see what are the results of using this operator on various values. In the
following example we add C<0> to C<False> values so they are not converted to
empty strings by C<say> function.

    say 1 || 1;
    say 0 || 1;
    say 0 || 0;
    say 'string' || 0;

=head3 Priority

As in a normal algebra the operators in Boolean algebra have their priority,
where different operators are evaluated earlier than others. Order of Boolean
operators:

    ! && ||

=head3 Combinations

C<NOT>, C<AND> and C<OR> can be combined altogether. You can use also brackets
to change the order of logical flow:

    say (1 || 0) && 1

=head4 Exercise

Fix the following statement by introducing brackets so it prints empty string
instead of C<1>.

    say  !1 || 1 && 1
    __TEST__
    is($stdout, "\n", 'Should be an empty string');

=head3 Comparison operators

Comparison operators also return C<True> and C<False> but are used with numbers
and strings. Because Perl does not distinguish between numbers and strings there
are two separate groups of comparison for numbers and strings.

=begin html

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>==</td><td>!=</td><td><</td><td><=</td><td>></td><td>>=</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>eq</td><td>ne</td><td>lt</td><td>le</td><td>gt</td><td>ge</td>
    </tr>
</table>

=end html

Let's try this example:

    say 1 == 1;
    say 10 > 2;
    say 3 <= 3;

    say 'foo' ne 'bar';

=head2 Conditional statements

Conditional statements allow you change the flow of the code. Conditional
statements operate with Boolean values that you've learned in a previous
chapter and include C<if/else/elsif> and C<unless>.

When the result of expression in the brackets is true than the block surrounded
by curly brackets is evaluated:

    if (1 == 1) {
        say 'True';
    }

    if (1 == 0) {
        say 'False';
    }

When you want to do something when the expression is false you can use C<else>:

    if (0) {
        say 'True';
    }
    else {
        say 'False';
    }

When you want to check the expression again you can use C<elsif>:

    my $x = 1;

    if ($x == 0) {
        say 'x is zero';
    } elsif ($x < 0) {
        say 'x is less than zero';
    } else {
        say 'x is more than zero';
    }

There is also a short form for C<if> statement:

    my $x = 5;
    say 'True' if $x > 0;

C<unless> is an opposite to C<if> where not the true value determines whether
the block is evaluated but the false value.

    my $x = 5;
    say 'True' unless $x == 0;

Which is the same as:

    my $x = 5;
    say 'True' if !($x == 0);

As you already know in Perl the truth values is everything that is not zero, so
comparizon to 0 usually is not needed:

    my $x = 5;
    say 'True' unless $x;

=head3 Exercise

Fix this code so it prints C<'Hello'> instead of C<'Bye'> by using logical
operator and without changing C<$x> value.

    my $x = 0;

    if ($x) {
        say 'Hello';
    }
    else {
        say 'Bye';
    }
    __TEST__
    like($code, qr/\$x = 0/, 'Should not change $x value');
    like($stdout, qr/Hello/, 'Should print "Hello"');

=head2 Loops

Loops are blocks that are evaluated several times. They are usually used for
repetitive actions, walking through the data structure etc.

=head3 For/Foreach

C<Foreach> loop is usually used for looping through the list or array. For
example:

    foreach my $element (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) {
        say $element;
    }

You can pass an array of course:

    my @array = (1 .. 5);
    foreach my $element (@array) {
        say $element;
    }

As you can see we create a special C<$element> variable that is aliased to every
array element on every iteration. Beware that by changing the C<$element> value
you change the actual value in the array:

    my @array = (1 .. 5);
    foreach my $element (@array) {
        $element *= 2;
    }

    foreach my $element (@array) {
        say $element;
    }

=head4 Exercise

Print only the even values from C<0> to C<10>:

    foreach my $element (...) {
        if (...) {
            ...
        }
    }
    __TEST__
    like($stdout, qr/0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10/, 'Should print even values');

=head3 While

C<While> is a more advanced loop that iterates while the expression is true.

    my $i = 10;
    while ($i > 0) {
        say $i;

        $i = $i - 1;
    }

As soon as expression C<< $i > 0 >> becomes false the loop stops.

=head4 Exercise

Print only the odd values from C<0> to C<10>:

    my $i = ;
    while ($i ...) {
        if (...) {
            ...
        }
    }
    __TEST__
    like($stdout, qr/1\n3\n5\n7\n9/, 'Should print odd values');

=head3 Getting out of the loop

Often you want to terminate the loop without waiting until it finishes. You
usually use the C<last> keyword:

    my $i = 0;
    while ($i < 100) {
        last if $i == 10;

        say $i;

        $i = $i + 1;
    }

This loop will not iterate C<100> times because we terminate it when C<$i> is
C<10>.

=head2 Default variable

The most used special variable is C<$_>, which is a default scalar variable. To
understand it better let's look at the examples.

You're familiar with C<say> function. It prints whatever you pass as arguments.
But what happens when you don't pass any arguments? It takes data from the
default C<$_> variable.

    $_ = 'Hello';
    say;

Of course you don't usually need this functionality, but it can very useful when
using loops for examples:

    say for (1 .. 10);

By default C<for> loop sets a C<$_> variable and C<say> prints it.

Many embedded Perl functions use default variable when no arguments are passed.

=head2 Subroutines

Subroutines are functions that accept arguments and can return the result.
Usually subroutines are used to eliminate duplication in code, make it clearer
and more understandable.

Let's say you want to convert 5 miles to kilometers. You would write something
like this:

    # Convert 5 miles to kilometers
    say 5 * 1.609344

But what if you wanted to convert 10 miles to kilometers or any other arbitrary
number? In this case we create a subroutine that we can use lately.

    sub miles_to_kilometers {
        my ($miles) = @_;

        return $miles * 1.609344;
    }

    say miles_to_kilometers(5);
    say miles_to_kilometers(10);
    say miles_to_kilometers(42);

The subroutine needs a bit of explanation. C<my ($miles) = @_> is called
C<arguments unpacking>. In Perl arguments when passed to the subroutine go the
default array C<@_> (this is also a special Per variable, just like C<$_>). You
can use all the array-specific functions on the default array too of course.

=head3 Exercise

Write and use a subroutine that converts kilometers to miles and prints 4, 6, 19
kilometers converted to miles (one kilometer is 0.621371192 miles).

    sub kilometers_to_miles {
        my ...

        return ...
    }

    say kilometers_to_miles(4);
    say kilometers_to_miles(6);
    say kilometers_to_miles(9);
    __TEST__
    like($stdout, qr/2.485484768\n3.728227152\n5.592340728/,
        'Should print correct values')

=head2 Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are a big part of the Perl language. They are essential to
know and use when processing texts. And that's what Perl is good for.

In short, regular expressions are special patterns when applied to strings
either match them or not, capture various substrings, modify the initial substring
by substituting parts of it and so on.

The most common usage for regular expression is to find out if a particular
string can be found in another string.

    my $string = 'Hello, world!';
    if ($string =~ m/Hello/) {
        say 'We found Hello!';
    }

So here are two new things: C<=~> and C<m//> (C<m> is for C<match>). There is
also an opposite C<!~> which is evaluated to C<True> when the regular expression
is not matched.

    my $string = 'Hello, world!';
    if ($string !~ m/Bye/) {
        say 'No Bye was found';
    }

Regular expressions can be really sophisticated. For example we want to check if
a string has C<a> B<or> C<o> characters:

    my $string = 'Hello';
    if ($string =~ m/a|o/) {
        say 'a or o was found';
    }

=head3 Metacharacters

Some characters in regular expression (as C<|> in previous example) are special. They
